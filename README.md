# Gradual Typing
Research Question: Does gradual typing help developers test their code?
- Alternative RQ: Do different type enforcement strategies reduce the effort needed to unit test a program?
- Definitions
  - **Gradual Typing**: Combination of static type system, dynamic type enforcement, and untyped programming language (syntax and semantics)
    - Typed Racket type system (very close to TypeScript)
      - Fix types
    - Racket
      - Fix benchmarks
    - Natural vs. Transient vs. Erasure
  - **Test**: Unit testing
    - All modules and all units (functions, classes, etc.)
      - Except fake modules
    - Integration testing?
    - System-wide testing?
    - Uniform tests because it's otherwise difficult to compare number of tests and size of tests (in terms of which criterion is better)
    - Unit testing should kill all mutants
  - **Help**: Reduce effort
  - **Code**: TR/R (Typed Racket / Racket) programs (GTP)
- If statement coverage is used for test minimization, the different mutation score graphs (along the lattice) illustrate whether statement coverage can be used with a specific semantic
- Test minimization options
  - Remove tests until the mutation score drops
  - Remove tests until criterion-based threshold
## Experiment Design
### Test Minimization
- Mutation Testing
  - Computationally expensive
  - Potentially use population subset
- Statement Coverage
  - Makes mutation testing redundant
  - Makes semantics indistinguishable
  - Need strategy for removing tests
### Lattice Traversal
- Preferred Strategies
  - Greedy
    - Calculate test minimization for every possible next step
    - Choose smallest test suite
    - Computationally expensive
  - Combination
    - Use alternate strategy to pick top two/three
    - Use greedy algorithm to pick best
- Alternate Strategies
  - Performance (Profiling)
  - Random
  - Complexity (Size of Modules/Tests)
  	- Smaller Modules for Ease
  	- Bigger Modules for Coverage
  	- Methods (Counting)
  		- Lines
  		- Symbolic Expressions
  		- Top-Level Definitions
  		- References to Other Modules
  		- External References
